# AI-Local-Machine
Project to build a fully locally managed AI Desktop Linux machine

Today, there are several tools available for running LLMs on desktop or server machines. 
- Via chat 
- Via an API 

This means you can choose which LLMs are open source, and which are best suited to the job you want them to do.

My intention, in this fast-changing landscape, is to offer a quick way of installing machines, then testing and using LLMs on the desktop as you wish.
